## Learning Goals 

### Introduction to Linear Regression 

Student should be able to:

* [ ] Identify problems where linear regression can be applied 
* [ ] Explain what a statistical model is in simple language 
* [ ] Describe what kind of DV is needed for linear regression
* [ ] Describe what kind of IVs can be used for linear regression 
* [ ] Define and describe a line of best fit 
* [ ] Define what a residual is 
* [ ] Describe what the slope of the model represents
* [ ] Run a linear regression model using `statsmodels` with a single continuous IV.

### Multiple Linear Regression + Assumptions 

By the end of the lesson, the student should be able to:

* [ ] Run a multiple linear regression model using `statsmodels`
* [ ] Explain how to interpret a coefficient in context of multiple regression 
* [ ] Explain how the idea of a hyperplane relates to bi-variate multiple regression  
* [ ] Run a multiple linear regression model using `statsmodels` with multiple continuous variables 
* [ ] Run a multiple linear regression model using `statsmodels` with multiple continuous and categorical variables.
* [ ] Explain what a `dummy coded` variable is in the context of linear regression 
* [ ] Interpret the coefficients, R2, p values, confidence intervals of each predictor variable 
* [ ] Explain what it means for observations to be independent
